I created a page using some Javascript, HTML, CSS, a little jquery, and some jSon. I took in data from the IMDB api http://www.omdbapi.com/ (Question #3), saved into the vars.js file, processed that info to the output.js file, and created divs from the output data.

I chose Bob's Burgers cause Bob's Burgers is awesome.

Enjoy!
